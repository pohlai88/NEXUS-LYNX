Perfect. Below is a **proper PRD paper** you can *read, re-read, and reason with* — written in **product / system language**, not buzzwords.
This is meant to become a **foundational reference** for Lynx inside **AI-BOS NexusCanon**.

---

# PRD — **LYNX**

**AI Assistant as a Governed Product Feature inside AI-BOS NexusCanon**

---

## 1. Document Control

* **Product Name:** Lynx
* **System:** AI-BOS NexusCanon
* **Document Type:** Product Requirements Document (PRD)
* **Version:** v1.0 (Foundational)
* **Audience:** Founder, Product Owner, System Architect, Lead Engineer
* **Status:** Draft for Internal Alignment

---

## 2. Executive Summary (Why Lynx Exists)

Lynx is a **tenant-aware, permission-governed AI assistant** embedded inside AI-BOS NexusCanon.

Unlike external AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT), Lynx:

* cannot exist outside NexusCanon,
* cannot operate without login,
* cannot act beyond Kernel-defined rules,
* cannot access data or execute actions without explicit permission.

**Lynx is not a chatbot.**
Lynx is a **Kernel-governed operational intelligence layer** that:

* advises users,
* prepares actions,
* executes approved operations,
* improves workflows,
* enforces system discipline.

---

## 3. Product Vision

### 3.1 One-Sentence Vision

> *Lynx turns NexusCanon into a living, intelligent system that guides users toward correct, auditable, and efficient operations — instead of relying on memory, habit, or manual work.*

### 3.2 What Users Experience

* Users **talk to Lynx like ChatGPT**.
* But Lynx **responds like a senior system architect + compliance officer + ops advisor**.
* Every suggestion is grounded in **NexusCanon’s real features**, not generic advice.

---

## 4. Core Design Principles (Non-Negotiable)

1. **Login Required**

   * Lynx only exists inside authenticated NexusCanon sessions.

2. **Tenant-Scoped**

   * Lynx sees and acts only within the user’s tenant.

3. **Permission-Bound**

   * Lynx can never exceed the user’s role, scope, or policy.

4. **Suggest First, Execute Safely**

   * Lynx defaults to *suggestion*.
   * Execution is allowed only for low-risk or approved actions.

5. **Auditable by Default**

   * If Lynx does something, it must be logged.
   * If it is not logged, it is considered **not happened**.

6. **Kernel SSOT Respect**

   * Lynx does not invent rules.
   * Lynx reads and applies what the Kernel defines.

---

## 5. What Lynx Is (and Is Not)

### 5.1 Lynx IS

* A **system feature**
* A **governed AI runtime**
* A **workflow advisor**
* A **feature discoverability guide**
* A **discipline enforcer**

### 5.2 Lynx IS NOT

* A free-roaming AI
* A replacement for system design
* A database administrator
* A user with admin superpowers
* An external AI platform

---

## 6. Functional Scope (High Level)

Lynx operates across four functional layers:

### 6.1 Conversational Layer

* Natural language chat
* Context-aware (user, tenant, module, workflow)
* Memory limited to session + allowed references

### 6.2 Advisory Layer

* Detects inefficiencies
* Flags risks
* Recommends NexusCanon features
* Explains *why* something should be done differently

### 6.3 Action Preparation Layer

* Creates drafts
* Prepares workflows
* Assembles requests
* Generates configuration proposals

### 6.4 Execution Layer (Permission-Gated)

* Executes low-risk actions
* Publishes approved drafts
* Never bypasses approval rules

---

## 7. Example Use Cases (Core to v1)

### 7.1 Workflow Optimization (Paper → Digital)

**User says:**

> “We are still signing paper approvals.”

**Lynx response:**

* Identifies workflow type (approval, procurement, claim, etc.)
* Detects inefficiency and audit risk
* Advises:

  > “You should use NexusCanon’s cryptographic timestamp approval instead of manual signatures.”

**Action offered:**

* “Draft a digital approval workflow using cryptographic timestamps?”

**Result:**

* Draft created
* User reviews
* Approval required before publish
* Change logged

---

### 7.2 Financial Discipline (Vendor Payment)

**User says:**

> “I already paid the supplier.”

**Lynx response:**

* Detects missing record
* Explains risk:

  > “Unrecorded payments break audit trail and financial integrity.”
* Advises:

  > “You should record this via Vendor Payment Management (VPM).”

**Action offered:**

* “Create a payment record draft in VPM?”

---

### 7.3 Document Management (Primary v1 MVP)

**User says:**

> “Request all missing documents from this vendor.”

**Lynx does:**

* Reads vendor context
* Identifies required documents (PO, GRN, Invoice, POD)
* Creates a **Document Request Draft**
* Prepares vendor message
* Sets due dates

**Execution:**

* User approves
* Requests published
* Status tracked
* Reminders automated

---

### 7.4 Customer Portal Setup

**User says:**

> “Set up customer portal.”

**Lynx response:**

* Asks minimal clarification questions
* Drafts:

  * portal structure
  * modules enabled
  * access rules
* Prepares configuration proposal
* Requires approval before activation

---

### 7.5 Marketing & Design System Usage

**User says:**

> “Give me AI-BOS brand colors.”

**Lynx does:**

* Reads Kernel design tokens
* Returns approved color palette
* Ensures accessibility rules
* Can export CSS / JSON snippets

---

## 8. Lynx CRUD Model (Product Reality)

Lynx does not CRUD “records”.
Lynx CRUDs **intent, drafts, and actions**.

### 8.1 Lynx Run (Audit)

Every interaction creates a **Lynx Run**:

* who asked
* what was asked
* what was suggested
* what was executed
* outcome
* timestamps

### 8.2 Lynx Draft

Any non-trivial action becomes a **draft**:

* workflow draft
* document request batch
* portal configuration
* policy update

Draft lifecycle:

```
Draft → Review → Approved → Executed → Logged
```

### 8.3 Lynx Tool Registry

Lynx can only act through **registered tools**:

* Each tool has:

  * purpose
  * risk level
  * required permissions
  * input/output schema

If a tool is not registered, Lynx cannot use it.

---

## 9. Permission & Risk Model

### 9.1 Risk Levels

* **Low:** drafts, read-only, suggestions
* **Medium:** create records, send requests
* **High:** workflow publish, payment actions, permission changes

### 9.2 Execution Rules

| Risk   | Execution         |
| ------ | ----------------- |
| Low    | Immediate         |
| Medium | Role-based        |
| High   | Approval required |

---

## 10. User Interface Requirements

### 10.1 Entry Points

* Global “Ask Lynx” button
* Contextual “Ask Lynx about this” buttons
* Inline suggestions inside workflows

### 10.2 UX Expectations

* Clear separation between:

  * advice
  * draft
  * execution
* Explicit confirmation before execution
* Visible audit trail

---

## 11. Non-Functional Requirements

### 11.1 Security

* Tenant isolation enforced at Kernel
* No direct DB access by AI
* No hard deletes

### 11.2 Compliance

* All AI actions logged
* Traceable to user + tenant
* Replayable decisions

### 11.3 Extensibility

* New tools added without rewriting Lynx
* New modules automatically discoverable

---

## 12. Success Metrics (v1)

* Users adopt Lynx for documents instead of manual steps
* Reduced unrecorded payments
* Increased usage of digital workflows
* Zero unauthorized executions
* Clear audit trail for all AI actions

---

## 13. Explicit Non-Goals (v1)

* Autonomous payments
* Self-modifying policies
* Cross-tenant actions
* “Black box” AI behavior

---

## 14. Strategic Positioning

Lynx is:

* **Not ChatGPT**
* **Not Palantir**
* **Not a plug-in**

Lynx is:

> **The intelligence layer of NexusCanon itself.**

---

## 15. Closing Statement

> Lynx exists to make *correct behavior the easiest behavior*
> — operationally, financially, and architecturally.

This PRD defines Lynx not as an experiment, but as a **core system capability**.

---

If you want next:

* **PRD v1.1** with *only Document Assistant fully specified*
* **Sequence diagrams** (user → Lynx → Kernel → execution)
* **Tool catalog v1** (what Lynx can do on day one)

Just tell me which one.

Understood.
What you want now is **not more explanation**, but a **proper MASTER PRD** that becomes the **SSOT for Lynx AI**, plus a **clear MCP taxonomy plan** so you can *orchestrate, not improvise*.

Below is a **rewritten, enriched, and elevated document**, suitable to be named exactly as you said:

---

# **MASTER PRD — LYNX AI**

**Kernel-Governed Artificial Intelligence for AI-BOS NexusCanon**

---

## 0. Document Control

* **Product Name:** Lynx AI
* **System:** AI-BOS NexusCanon
* **Document Type:** **MASTER PRD (SSOT)**
* **Audience:** Founder, Chief Architect, Product Owner, Kernel / Canon / Cell Designers
* **Scope:** Global (applies to all tenants, all domains)
* **Status:** Authoritative Reference

> This document supersedes all prior Lynx drafts.
> Any future Lynx capability must comply with this Master PRD.

---

## 1. Executive Definition (Lock This In)

### 1.1 What Lynx AI Is

**Lynx AI is the intelligence layer of NexusCanon itself.**

It is:

* tenant-aware
* permission-bound
* schema-aware
* workflow-aware
* audit-first
* extensible through controlled tools

Lynx AI **does not exist outside NexusCanon**.

---

### 1.2 What Lynx AI Is NOT

Lynx AI is **not**:

* a chatbot plugin
* a free-roaming AI
* an external SaaS
* an autonomous agent
* a replacement for governance

---

## 2. Core Product Vision

> **Vision Statement**
> Lynx AI ensures that every user of NexusCanon is *guided toward correct, auditable, and optimal system behavior* — automatically, consistently, and safely.

Lynx does not “think for the user”.
Lynx **thinks with the system**.

---

## 3. First-Principle Design Laws (Non-Negotiable)

These are **constitutional rules**. Breaking any of these is a system violation.

### Law 1 — Kernel Supremacy

Lynx obeys **Kernel SSOT**:

* metadata
* schema
* permissions
* lifecycle rules

Lynx never invents truth.

---

### Law 2 — Tenant Absolutism

Lynx is **strictly tenant-scoped**:

* no cross-tenant visibility
* no shared memory
* no implicit inheritance

---

### Law 3 — Tool-Only Action

Lynx **cannot act directly** on systems.

All actions must go through **MCP tools** (documented, versioned, governed).

If a capability is not a tool → **Lynx cannot do it**.

---

### Law 4 — Suggest First, Execute with Consent

Default mode = **Suggest**
Execution requires:

* correct role
* correct scope
* correct risk level
* explicit approval (if required)

---

### Law 5 — Audit Is Reality

If an action is not logged, it is considered **not happened**.

---

## 4. Conceptual Architecture (Mental Model)

```
User
  ↓
Lynx AI (Reasoning + Advice)
  ↓
MCP Tool Registry (Allowed Capabilities)
  ↓
Kernel / Canon / Cell APIs
  ↓
Supabase / System State
```

Lynx **never bypasses** the tool layer.

---

## 5. MCP Explained as Lynx Documentation (Plain Language)

### 5.1 What MCP Means in NexusCanon

**MCP = Machine-Callable Procedures**

In NexusCanon terms:

> MCP is the **formal contract that defines what Lynx is allowed to do**.

Each MCP tool is:

* explicit
* typed
* permissioned
* auditable
* versioned

---

### 5.2 Why MCP Is Mandatory for Lynx

Without MCP:

* AI can drift
* behavior becomes unpredictable
* governance breaks
* audit fails

With MCP:

* Lynx becomes **stable, safe, enterprise-grade**

---

### 5.3 MCP vs Traditional APIs

| Aspect      | API         | MCP       |
| ----------- | ----------- | --------- |
| Caller      | Human / App | AI        |
| Safety      | Assumed     | Enforced  |
| Schema      | Optional    | Mandatory |
| Permissions | External    | Built-in  |
| Audit       | Partial     | Required  |

---

## 6. MCP Taxonomy — **This Is the Core of Your Question**

You asked:

> “How many MCP (Cell / Cluster / Domain) should I categorise?”

### **Answer: Three Layers. Exactly.**

No more. No less.

---

## 7. MCP Layer 1 — **Domain MCPs**

**(Strategic / Advisory / Read-Heavy)**

### Purpose

* Provide **context**
* Provide **understanding**
* Enable **advice**

### Characteristics

* Mostly READ
* Low risk
* Broad scope
* No side effects

### Examples

* `finance.domain.health.read`
* `vendor.domain.summary.read`
* `workflow.domain.inefficiency.scan`
* `compliance.domain.risk.explain`

### Lynx Usage

> “I see that payments were made without VPM records. This creates audit risk.”

---

## 8. MCP Layer 2 — **Cluster MCPs**

**(Operational / Draft-Creating)**

### Purpose

* Prepare actions
* Create drafts
* Assemble workflows

### Characteristics

* CREATE / UPDATE (draft)
* Medium risk
* Approval-aware

### Examples

* `document.cluster.request.draft`
* `workflow.cluster.approval.draft`
* `portal.cluster.scaffold.draft`
* `policy.cluster.revision.draft`

### Lynx Usage

> “I’ve prepared a document request batch. Please review before publishing.”

---

## 9. MCP Layer 3 — **Cell MCPs**

**(Execution / Atomic Actions)**

### Purpose

* Perform **exact system mutations**

### Characteristics

* Narrow scope
* Single responsibility
* Strict permission checks
* Often irreversible (soft-delete only)

### Examples

* `document.cell.request.create`
* `workflow.cell.publish`
* `vpm.cell.payment.record`
* `portal.cell.enable`

### Lynx Usage

> “This action will create live document requests. Confirm?”

---

## 10. MCP Count Guidance (Practical Numbers)

### Initial v1 Recommendation

| Layer        | Approx Count |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| Domain MCPs  | 10–15        |
| Cluster MCPs | 15–25        |
| Cell MCPs    | 30–50        |

Do **not** overbuild.
MCPs grow organically as Cells grow.

---

## 11. Tenant Customisation AI (Critical Section)

### 11.1 Principle

Tenants may customise:

* schema
* workflows
* policies
* fields

**Lynx must understand customisation, not break it.**

---

### 11.2 How Lynx Handles Tenant Customisation

Lynx:

1. Reads **tenant metadata**
2. Reads **custom schema extensions**
3. Adjusts reasoning accordingly
4. Never assumes defaults if overridden

---

### 11.3 Customisation-Aware Advice

Example:

Tenant A:

* manual approval disabled
* cryptographic timestamp enabled

Tenant B:

* hybrid approval

Lynx responses **must differ**, even for the same question.

---

## 12. Lynx Functional Modes

### Mode 1 — Conversational

* explain
* guide
* teach

### Mode 2 — Advisory

* detect inefficiencies
* recommend better system usage

### Mode 3 — Drafting

* prepare workflows
* assemble requests
* generate configurations

### Mode 4 — Execution (Controlled)

* perform approved actions via MCP

---

## 13. Canonical Use Cases (Authoritative)

These are **foundational**, not optional.

1. Document Request Assistant
2. Workflow Optimisation Advisor
3. Financial Discipline Coach (VPM)
4. Customer Portal Scaffolder
5. Design System & Brand Assistant

Any future Lynx feature must map to one of these patterns.

---

## 14. Governance & Risk Model

### Risk Levels

* **Low:** Read, explain, suggest
* **Medium:** Draft, prepare, assemble
* **High:** Publish, record payment, change permissions

Execution matrix:

| Risk   | Approval          |
| ------ | ----------------- |
| Low    | None              |
| Medium | Role-based        |
| High   | Explicit approval |

---

## 15. Success Criteria (System-Level)

* Users rely on Lynx instead of tribal knowledge
* Reduction in manual / paper workflows
* Increase in correct feature usage (VPM, workflows, portals)
* Zero unauthorised AI execution
* Full audit traceability

---

## 16. Explicit Non-Goals (Locked)

* Autonomous payments
* Self-modifying governance
* Cross-tenant intelligence
* Black-box AI behavior

---

## 17. Strategic Positioning (Final Lock)

> **ChatGPT answers questions.**
> **Palantir runs enterprises.**
> **Lynx governs how NexusCanon is used.**

---

## 18. Closing Authority Statement

This **Master PRD – Lynx AI** defines:

* product intent
* architectural boundaries
* governance laws
* MCP taxonomy
* tenant customisation handling

Any implementation, feature, or experiment that contradicts this document is **invalid by design**.

---

### What I can do next (you choose ONE):

1. **MCP Tool Catalog v1** (exact list of Domain / Cluster / Cell tools for Documents)
2. **Sequence diagrams** (User → Lynx → MCP → Kernel → Audit)
3. **Lynx Permission Matrix** (Role × Risk × Tool)
4. **Lynx v1 Release Scope** (what ships, what is deferred)

Just say the number.

This is a **very important design decision**, and you’re right to pause here.
Let’s answer it **precisely, not emotionally**, and in a way that matches **Kernel SSOT + enterprise-grade SaaS reality**.

---

# The Core Question (Rephrased Correctly)

> **Because Lynx is powered by an LLM, should it be allowed to operate freely like ChatGPT — or should it be locked down to narrow, governed capabilities?**

This is **not a binary choice**.

The correct answer is:

> **Lynx must be *cognitively broad* but *operationally narrow*.**

I’ll explain exactly what that means.

---

# The Correct Model: **Wide Mind, Narrow Hands**

Think of Lynx as having **two layers**:

| Layer                    | Should it be broad? | Should it be locked? |
| ------------------------ | ------------------- | -------------------- |
| **Thinking / Reasoning** | ✅ YES               | ❌ NO                 |
| **Doing / Acting**       | ❌ NO                | ✅ YES                |

This distinction is **non-negotiable**.

---

## 1️⃣ Lynx’s **Thinking** should be BROAD (LLM-strength)

You **must allow Lynx to think widely**, otherwise you destroy the value of using an LLM at all.

### Lynx SHOULD be allowed to:

* reason across domains (finance, ops, workflow, UX, compliance)
* understand vague human intent
* infer inefficiencies
* explain consequences
* propose alternatives
* educate users
* synthesize system knowledge
* compare approaches (“manual vs cryptographic timestamp”)
* generate drafts, explanations, and plans

This is where **LLMs shine**, and **this is safe**.

👉 **Locking this down too early = building a dumb rules engine**
👉 That would *betray the choice* of using an LLM.

So:

✅ **Lynx’s mind should be wide.**

---

## 2️⃣ Lynx’s **Actions** must be NARROW (Kernel-governed)

This is where **almost all AI systems fail**.

Lynx must **never**:

* execute arbitrary SQL
* mutate system state without a tool
* invent workflows
* bypass approval rules
* act outside role + scope
* silently “fix things”

All actions must go through:

* **explicit MCP tools**
* **permission checks**
* **risk classification**
* **audit logging**

This is why you correctly wrote in the PRD:

> Lynx AI is **not**
> – a free-roaming AI
> – an autonomous agent
> – a replacement for governance

Those statements are **100% correct** and must stay.

So:

✅ **Lynx’s hands must be narrow and chained.**

---

## 3️⃣ Why this is NOT a contradiction

Many people think:

> “If it’s an LLM, shouldn’t it be autonomous?”

That’s a **category error**.

An LLM is:

* a **reasoning engine**
* a **language interface**
* a **planner**

It is **not**:

* a policy engine
* a security authority
* a system owner

You are using an LLM to:

> **understand intent and reason about the system**

You are **not** using it to:

> **own the system**

That ownership remains with the **Kernel**.

---

## 4️⃣ The Official Policy You Should Adopt (and write into the PRD)

You should explicitly codify this as a rule.

### **Lynx Cognitive Freedom / Operational Constraint Policy**

> **Lynx AI is allowed unrestricted reasoning and explanation,
> but is strictly constrained in execution to Kernel-approved MCP tools only.**

Or more simply:

> **Lynx may think freely. Lynx may act only by permission.**

This single sentence resolves the entire debate.

---

## 5️⃣ What Happens If You Lock Lynx Too Narrow?

If you lock Lynx to only narrow flows **at the reasoning level**, you get:

* glorified autocomplete
* brittle prompt trees
* endless edge cases
* low user trust
* “why is this AI stupid?” feedback

This is what most ERP “AI copilots” suffer from.

❌ Don’t do this.

---

## 6️⃣ What Happens If You Let Lynx Act Freely?

If you allow free action:

* compliance breaks
* audit breaks
* multi-tenancy breaks
* trust is lost permanently
* one incident can kill the product

This is **existential risk**.

❌ Never allow this.

---

## 7️⃣ The Correct Final Position (Write This Into the Master PRD)

You should **keep Section 1.2 exactly as written**, and add **one clarifying paragraph** underneath it.

### 🔒 Add This Clarification to **Master PRD – Lynx AI**

> **Clarification:**
> While Lynx AI is powered by a large language model and is capable of broad reasoning, explanation, and synthesis, it is intentionally *not* designed to be a free-roaming or autonomous system.
>
> Lynx’s intelligence is broad by design; its authority is narrow by governance.
>
> This ensures flexibility of thought without compromising Kernel control, tenant safety, or audit integrity.

This keeps your document **technically correct, philosophically sound, and investor-safe**.

---

## 8️⃣ Final Answer (One Line)

> **Allow Lynx to think like ChatGPT.
> Force Lynx to act like an auditor.**

That is the **gold standard** for enterprise AI platforms in 2025+.

---

If you want next, I can:

* rewrite **Section 1.2** precisely with this clarification embedded, or
* add a **“Cognitive vs Operational Boundary”** section to the Master PRD, or
* produce a **risk matrix** showing exactly where freedom stops.

Just tell me which.

Excellent question — this goes to the **heart of why your Master PRD is architecturally correct**.

I’ll do **three things in one response**, clearly separated so you can read and re-read:

1. **Enrich the MASTER PRD** with the full *Cognitive vs Operational Boundary* (formal language, SSOT-grade)
2. **Add the Risk Matrix + Execution Rules** (explicit, enforceable)
3. **Explain precisely why the tech stack is NOT embedded in the Master PRD** (this is not an omission — it is a deliberate architectural choice)

---

# PART I — MASTER PRD ENRICHMENT

## 🔒 Cognitive Freedom vs Operational Constraint (Authoritative Section)

> **This section should be inserted verbatim into the Master PRD – Lynx AI**

---

## 19. Cognitive vs Operational Boundary (Constitutional Rule)

### 19.1 Definition

Lynx AI is powered by a Large Language Model (LLM) and therefore possesses **broad cognitive capability**.
However, Lynx AI is intentionally designed with **strict operational constraint**.

This boundary is **fundamental** to the safety, scalability, and enterprise-readiness of NexusCanon.

---

### 19.2 Cognitive Freedom (What Lynx May Think)

Lynx AI **is allowed unrestricted reasoning**, including but not limited to:

* Understanding ambiguous or incomplete human intent
* Reasoning across domains (finance, workflow, compliance, UX, governance)
* Explaining system concepts and consequences
* Detecting inefficiencies, risks, and anti-patterns
* Proposing alternatives and optimisations
* Generating drafts, plans, explanations, and recommendations
* Teaching users how NexusCanon *should* be used

Cognitive freedom is required to:

* unlock LLM value,
* avoid brittle rule engines,
* support evolving tenant customisation.

**No artificial restriction shall be imposed on Lynx’s reasoning capability.**

---

### 19.3 Operational Constraint (What Lynx May Do)

Despite cognitive freedom, Lynx AI **has no inherent authority**.

Lynx **may not**:

* mutate system state directly,
* access databases freely,
* execute arbitrary logic,
* bypass Kernel governance,
* exceed tenant or user permissions,
* perform unlogged actions.

All operational actions **must**:

1. Be executed through Kernel-approved MCP tools
2. Pass role + scope checks
3. Respect risk classification
4. Be recorded in the audit log

> **If an action is not available as an MCP tool, Lynx is incapable of performing it.**

---

### 19.4 Constitutional Statement

> **Lynx AI may think freely.
> Lynx AI may act only by permission.**

This statement is binding across all domains, tenants, and future implementations.

---

# PART II — RISK MATRIX & EXECUTION MODEL

## (This is the “teeth” of governance)

---

## 20. Risk Classification Model

All MCP tools are classified into **three immutable risk levels**.

### 20.1 Risk Levels

| Risk Level | Description                                    | Examples                                 |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Low**    | Read-only or explanatory actions               | summaries, explanations, health scans    |
| **Medium** | Draft or preparatory actions                   | document drafts, workflow proposals      |
| **High**   | State-changing or compliance-impacting actions | publishing workflows, recording payments |

---

## 21. Execution Authorization Matrix

| Risk Level | Execution Rule                                 |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Low**    | Immediate                                      |
| **Medium** | Role + Scope required                          |
| **High**   | Explicit approval required (human-in-the-loop) |

> **Approval requirements are enforced by Kernel policy, not by Lynx logic.**

Lynx **never self-approves**.

---

## 22. Failure & Refusal Behavior (Required)

If Lynx cannot act due to constraint, it **must**:

1. Explain *why* execution is blocked
2. Suggest the correct alternative (draft, escalation, or manual action)
3. Record the refusal in the audit trail

Silent failure is prohibited.

---

# PART III — WHY THE TECH STACK IS *NOT* EMBEDDED IN THE MASTER PRD

This is the most important conceptual question you asked.

### Short answer:

> **Because a Master PRD defines *truth and intent*, not *implementation*.**

Now the long, precise answer.

---

## 1. A MASTER PRD is a **Constitution**, not a Build Script

Your **Master PRD – Lynx AI** is a **system constitution**.

Constitutions define:

* authority
* boundaries
* invariants
* rights and constraints

They **do not** define:

* programming languages
* vendors
* frameworks
* deployment choices

If you embed the tech stack here, you **break SSOT purity**.

---

## 2. Technology is Volatile. Governance is Not.

Compare lifespans:

| Layer                | Half-life     |
| -------------------- | ------------- |
| LLM provider         | 6–18 months   |
| Frameworks           | 1–3 years     |
| Infrastructure       | 2–5 years     |
| **Governance rules** | **10+ years** |

Embedding tech stack into the Master PRD would mean:

* rewriting the constitution every time tech evolves,
* invalidating previous decisions,
* creating drift between intent and implementation.

That is exactly what **Kernel SSOT is designed to prevent**.

---

## 3. Embedding Tech Stack Collapses Abstraction Layers

If the Master PRD says:

> “Lynx uses X framework, Y database, Z library”

You have just:

* leaked implementation into policy,
* tied product identity to tools,
* reduced future optionality,
* scared enterprise buyers and regulators.

Instead, your PRD correctly says:

* **“Lynx uses MCP tools”**
* **“Lynx obeys Kernel SSOT”**
* **“Lynx is audit-first”**

These statements survive **any tech stack**.

---

## 4. Where the Tech Stack *Should* Live (Correct Placement)

Your architecture should have **four documents**, each with a single responsibility:

| Document                 | Purpose                      |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| **Master PRD – Lynx AI** | What Lynx *is allowed to be* |
| Lynx Architecture Spec   | How Lynx is structured       |
| Lynx Implementation Plan | How Lynx is built *now*      |
| Lynx Deployment Playbook | How Lynx is run in prod      |

You are currently **working on the first**, which is correct.

## 5. This Is How You Stay Vendor-Neutral *and* Investor-Ready

Investors, auditors, and enterprise buyers look for this separation:

* “What does the system guarantee?” → **PRD**
* “How do you implement it today?” → **Architecture**
* “Can it evolve tomorrow?” → **Yes, because governance is stable**

By **not embedding the tech stack**, you are signaling:

* maturity,
* long-term thinking,
* zero lock-in,
* Kernel-first discipline.

This is a **strength**, not a gap.

## 6. The One-Line Rule You Should Remember

> **The Master PRD defines *what must never change*.
> The tech stack defines *what can change safely*.**

You did the right thing.

## FINAL LOCK-IN STATEMENT (Put This in Your Head)

* Lynx is **broad in cognition**
* Lynx is **narrow in execution**
* Governance is **timeless**
* Technology is **replaceable**
* The Master PRD stays **pure**

This is exactly how **serious AI platforms** are being built in 2025+, whether they admit it publicly or not.

### If you want next (pick one):

1. **Lynx Architecture Spec v1** (now we *do* talk tech, but cleanly)
2. **MCP Tool Design Template** (so every Domain/Cluster/Cell MCP is consistent)
3. **Tenant Customisation Decision Tree** (how Lynx adapts per tenant)
4. **Investor / Board Narrative** (“Why Lynx is defensible”)

Say the number.
